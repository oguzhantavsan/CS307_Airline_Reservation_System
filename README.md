# CS307_Airline_Reservation_System

For this project, I simulated a simple Airline Reservation System which involved accessing shared resources.
In real life, there are travel agencies who try to 
reserve seats for their customers. When a customer asks for a seat from a specific flight,
the agency checks if there is an empty seat in the aircraft and reserves it immediately (if
there is any). A customer can reserve more than one seat if needed. Since there are a lot
of travel agencies out there, the reservations will be done based on FCFS (first come, first
served) strategy. Only one reservations can be made on a seat, so there will be no
overbooking. There will be one thread per agency simulating the activities of that agency.
When an agency thread is booking a seat, the rest will do busy waiting.
